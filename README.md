# Coolio

Coolio is a Raspberry Pi Python fan and temperature controller using a Flask website.  I developed it to control the temperature in our electronics room, which is the room under the stairs - we call it the Harry Potter room.

The Python code is based on the excellent work done by Miguel Grinberg in his [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
